# About Me
Hello, I'm hayden, a graduate student major in computer science at Harbin Institue of Techonology, Harbin, China.

For now, my reserach mainly focuses on image restoration and image enhancement. I'm enthusiastic about designing algorithms related to above tasks via deep learning and optimization-based methods.

Prior to that, I got a B.E. in mechatronics from Harbin Institute of Technology. My graduation thesis is about [tensegrity structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity) and its application on soft robotics.

To find more detailed information about my projects, visit my own [project website](https://quartetweb.wordpress.com/).
